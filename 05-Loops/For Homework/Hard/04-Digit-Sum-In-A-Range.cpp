 * @file      Homework Hard [4] : Problem #4: Digit Sum In A Range.
 * @details   Description.
                ● Read three integers; N, A, and B
                ● Print the sum of the numbers between 1 and N, whose sum of digits is between A and B.
                ● Input ⇒ output
                    ○ 20 2 5 ⇒ 84
                        ■ The numbers from 1 to 20, whose sums of digits are between 2 and 5 are:
                        2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14, 20. Add these up to get 84!
                ● e.g. digits sum of 13 is 4: which is between (2, 5)
                    ○ 10 1 2 ⇒ 13
                    ○ 100 4 16 ⇒ 4554
